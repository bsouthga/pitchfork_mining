Mining with Pitchfork
=====================

This is a little project to see the if there are any patterns to the reviews that [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com) has written over the years.

Specifically, I intend to investigate the "Sophomore Slump" -- the percieved reduction in score a band recieves for their second album.

[Metacritic](http://metacritic.com) data will also be utilized to investigate any systematic bias in any direction relative to other known critics.
